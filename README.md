# RecyclingSymbols

Create Recycling Symbols for pretty much every plastic on Wikipedia.
So far only the Recycling symbold works.

Feel free to PR more symbols.

## RUN
You'll need Python, SolidPython and OpenSCAD. See notes in `Recycling_Symbols.py`.
Then you just run `Recycling_Symbols.py` and wait for the symbols to be created.

It will create a STL file for each line in `codelist.txt`
